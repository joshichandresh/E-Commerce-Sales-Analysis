<h1>SUPERSTORE E-Commerce (Sales & Profits Analysis)</h1>
<h3>EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW:</h3>
<p>On this project I decided to use the SuperStore dataset which represents a sample of online sales for USA retailer store. It includes information of orders, multiple categories, and geographical locations. This is an external and open-source dataset that was created for educational purposes in order to familiarize its new users to visualizations. The data was not collected and was generated fictitiously to simulate a retail business. Therefore, extrapolating its behavior to generalize or draw conclusions about similar type of businesses is not recommended.</p>
<h2>Business Questions:</h2>
<ol>
<ol>Which states and cities are generating the highest revenue?</ol>
  <ol>Which product category is both the best-selling and the most profitable?</ol>
   <ol>Which product sub-categories and specific products are top performers as well as those that are underperforming?</ol>
   <ol>Are there products that are frequently bought together?</ol>
   <ol>Which customer segment is bringing in the most profit?</ol>
   <ol>What is the most preferred shipping mode among our customers?</ol>
